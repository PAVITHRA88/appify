Here I have used Datamuse public API.
here I faced CORS preflight issue, which I tried multiple solutions like adding headers like Access-control-allow-*.
One working solution is to disable the web security in browsers : 
   1 - open Run 
   2 - type => chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C://Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security
   3 - a browser window will open where the api will work.
